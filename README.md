Pithos for Windows
=============

Pithos is a native Pandora Radio client for ~~Linux~~ Windows. It's much more lightweight
than the Pandora.com web client.

Installation
-----------
Check the [downloads](https://github.com/TingPing/pithos-for-windows/downloads) section to get an installer.

There is now only one installer, you must download/install all the extra ones manually due to them being embeded sometimes failing.

See ([redist.txt](https://github.com/TingPing/pithos-for-windows/blob/master/windows/redist.txt) for what you need installed, some are required others optional.

NOTE: The Pithos installer MUST be ran last.

Installer requires .net2+ and ran as Admin.

Only download the most recent version and if you have used Full installer once only update with Minimal installer.

Notes
-----
Please comment or open issues for anything you'd like to see.

The gstreamer installer is known to fail and create empty folders; Uninstall Gstreamer and reinstall to remedy this.

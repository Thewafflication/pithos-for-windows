Pithos for Windows
=============

Pithos is a native Pandora Radio client for ~~Linux~~ Windows. It's much more lightweight than the Pandora.com web client.

**NOTE** This project is no longer maintained, upstream [Pithos](https://github.com/pithos/pithos) is active again and now has basic Windows support. This version is currently still easier to install and use but over the next many months hopefully this will change.


Installation
-----------
Newest release can be found [here](https://github.com/TingPing/pithos-for-windows/releases) and read notes below.

64bit users can just download this [zip](https://github.com/TingPing/pithos-for-windows/archive/master.zip) and extract it, though 64bit isn't recommended and you will have to manage the dependencies yourself.

See [redist.txt](https://github.com/TingPing/pithos-for-windows/blob/master/windows/redist.txt) for optional plugin requirements.

Notes
-----

You must remove pygtk if installed with an older version.

If Python is installed to a custom directory(not C:\python27) it must be in the PATH environment variable to work (google to find out how) 

If previous versions crashed please try out the newest version as this has been resolved.

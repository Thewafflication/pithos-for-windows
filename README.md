Pithos for Windows
=============

Pithos is a native Pandora Radio client for ~~Linux~~ Windows. It's much more lightweight than the Pandora.com web client.

Installation
-----------
Download Version 8 [here](http://dl.tingping.se/win32/pithos_for_windows/Pithos_Installer-Version8.exe) and read notes below.

64bit users can just download this [zip](https://github.com/TingPing/pithos-for-windows/archive/master.zip) and extract it, though 64bit isn't recommended and you will have to manage the dependencies yourself.

See [redist.txt](https://github.com/TingPing/pithos-for-windows/blob/master/windows/redist.txt) for optional plugin requirements.

Notes
-----

You must remove pygtk if installed with an older version.

If Python is installed to a custom directory(not C:\python27) it must be in the PATH environment variable to work (google to find out how) 

If previous versions crashed please try out the newest version as this has been resolved.
